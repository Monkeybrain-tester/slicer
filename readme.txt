You SHOULD be able to setup the github and pull this project DIRECTLY into your godot project and it
will config itself

just make a new godot project
right click on res:// in the filessystem window (typically bottom left corner)
open in terminal

run git init
git clone <repository url>
git pull

then whenever you commit
git commit -m "commit message goes in this string"
